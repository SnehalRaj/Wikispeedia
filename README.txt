This assignment uses python3. The dependencies for the project are pandas which can be installed by pip install pandas

All the raw data files are contained in the folder raw_data

All the necessary tsv files have been modified by just removing the lines in the start. The lines denoted by # have been removed manually by me.

All the parts are combined into a single script file assign2.sh


Alternatively, the assignment can also be opened by 

$jupyter notebook

As all the notebooks have also been included along with the files.

All the necessary csv files are also included with the submission.
